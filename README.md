# WordLadder

Algorithm that finds the shortest sequence from one word to another by changing one letter at at time, forming valid words at each step in the sequence along the way. This was a part of the second assignment submitted in Stanford's Programming Abstractions class.

Full spec is included in the repository under 'ADT.pdf' on pages 1-4.
