# WordLadder

All implementation occurs in the WordLadder.cpp file inside src folder, which applies an algorithm to find the shortest sequence from one word to another by changing one letter at at time, forming valid words at each step in the sequence along the way.

Full spec is included in the repository under 'ADT.pdf' on pages 1-4.
